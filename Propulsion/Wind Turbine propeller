Windmill Driven Propeller

Vertical Axis Windmill for ease of use (no need to turn Wind Turbine column to the wind)
Using Adjustable Diameter Pulley at Wind Turbine shaft and Propeller shaft for speed adjustments.  
A tension pulley between the two also needed.  

Safety Considerations. Wind Turbine Shaft pulley should default smallest diameter if control cable breaks.  Like wise Propeller shaft pulley diameter should default to largest diameter if it's control cable breaks.

If propeller column is attached to the rudder, need a easy method to turn the propeller 180 degrees from rudder to reverse maneuvers.

1 inch belt or rope strong enough for the torque involved?
