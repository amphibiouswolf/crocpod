Croc Pod

Why the name Croc Pod?  Well they are animals that use both land and water, though happier in the water.
Croc pod is a tow-able, floating living space.  Water locomotion via Sails, Engine, or windmill driven propeller.  Goal of a tiny home with a flat bottom, equally at home on land or water.  Basic hull design being a flat bottom rectangular barge. Include attachment points at corners,  Initial thoughts using twist locks like used on shipping containers.  Basic premise, all Croc Pods float, no matter if set on land or a marina slip.  For ease of building, no thru hull's below the water line.


Getting started.

Needing to settle on a common hull size, with trade off's of space verses maneuverability.  Multiples of 8 or 4, since ease of getting 4x8 plywood sheets.  Total Height with trailer should be equal to or less than 13.5 feet.  Sail and Windmill versions need way to lower/detach sails, mast, etc for tow transit.

Hull 8x32 feet
 Pros
  Shorter length to maneuver.
  Lower weight.
  Fewer materials needed for build.
  4 hulls side by side makes a 32x32 square.
 Cons
  Less cargo space.

Hull 8x34 feet
 Pros
  More Storage space
 Cons
  Harder to maneuver.
  More materials needed for build.
  Heavier weight.

Work needed.
 Open sourced hull plans.  Preferred verified by marine engineer.  Blueprints a bonus.
 Open sourced sail plans for Decided hull plan.  With ease of removal of mast considered.
 Windmill Driven version need way to remove and store components during road transit.
 Design Modular Hulls that fit with Croc Pods hull design and attaches securely to the pod.
  1) Version with a Keel and Mast supports for bigger mast.  Goal for traditional Blue Water Sailing
  2) Version with two Crop Pod slots.  Goal, each Pod becomes a hull of a catamaran type structure.  So two pods
     can sail/motor together.  Or one Croc Pod as living quarters, and second Croc pod sized hull designed for 
     cargo.
  3) Version reinforced hull skin for Coastal boaters.  Help protect against coral or rock formations.
  4) Versions 1 and 3 with additional beam, and or bow and aft lengths.

 Interior Plans and DIY appliances
  1) Composting type toilets.
  2) Table and Chair designs.
  3) Cabinet designs handle rough seas/road ways
  4) Safe lighting.
  5) Piping you can lower into surrounding water for pumping in lake/sea water for initial dish cleaning, etc.
  6) Safe and light weight heating.
  7) Water maker.

 Computer Ideas
  1) Using Raspberry Pi to run a low energy media center
  2) Raspberry Pi used as GPS with Open Source Software
  3) Bonus if GPS Pi dies, can pull out Media Pi to get replace if needed.
